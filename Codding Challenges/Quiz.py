# Challenge: Implement a student grading system 
# that consists of three modules: a main module, a grading module, and a 
# student module. The main module should use the grading and student modules 
# to calculate the final grades for a group of students.


# The grading module should contain functions to calculate the grades for 
# individual assignments and for the overall course grade. The student module 
# should contain a class definition for a Student object, which stores the student's name, 
# ID, and assignment grades.

# Here are the requirements for the grading system:

# # The grading module should have a function that takes a 
# list of grades as input and returns the average grade.

# The grading module should have a function that takes a list of grades and a
#  weight for each assignment, and returns the weighted average grade.

# The grading module should have a function that takes a list of weighted 
# grades and their corresponding weights, and returns the overall course grade.

# The student module should define a Student class that stores the student's name, ID, 
# and assignment grades.

# The Student class should have methods to add an assignment grade and to 
# calculate the overall course grade.

# The main module should create a list of Student objects, 
# add assignment grades for each student, and then calculate the overall course grades 
# using the grading module.

# To complete this challenge, you will need to create three separate Python files: 
# one for the main module, one for the grading module, and one for the student module. 
# You will also need to use the import statement to import the necessary modules and 
# functions/classes.

# Good luck!
