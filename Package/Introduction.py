# While working on big projects, we have to deal with a 
# large amount of code, and writing everything together in the
# same file will make our code look messy. Instead, we can separate 
# our code into multiple files by keeping the related code together in packages.

# Now, we can use the package whenever we need it in our projects. 
# This way we can also reuse our code.
